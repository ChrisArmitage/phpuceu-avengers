Bunch of coders at PHP Unconference Europe, doing silly code in the sun

I fancied doing something silly, but useful. So I'm going to create the Avengers in PHP. Try out some new practices, get some colab coding going on, see where we end up.

## Update
We have a basic framework in place. With test coverage and Scruitinizer integration. Now the fun starts.

The ideas include:
- Avengers will have a check to see if they can be assembled (think when Bruce is off the radar)
- Use Factories to make the characters
- Use a Timeline / Universe ENV var to allow for variations on characters

Any and all input is welcome, see it as a way of trying out different design patterns to achieve our goal. Just be nice about your input (no calling me names cos I used the wrong technique!)
